This program reads a ROM file and convert the game code in PRG ROM to C++ code. The generated code can be added to a C++ project with emulated PPU and APU to compile a PC executable of the game. The executable still require the original ROM for CHR data and PRG data.

Usage: Select a ROM file and press the "Process" button. This will generate some sort of disassembly. Move to the second tab, click the "Export" button to save the generated disasembly to a file. Press the "Analyze" button to convert the disassembly to C++ representation. Then move to the third tab and press the "Generate" button to generate C++ code and function headers. Copy the C++ code to the gameCode.cpp and headers to game.hpp of the specialized C++ project and compile the game. To restart directly at the analyze step, select the ROM file, press the "Load" button and pick the saved disassembly file. 

The program breaks the code into sections by:
1. Three vectors
2. JSR
3. JMP across sections

Then the program runs the following steps:
1. Identify loops.
2. Resolve overlapping loops.
3. Form the loop structures. 
4. Identify breaks from loops.
5. Identify infinite loops and cut infinite loops into separate sections. This happens at the end of reset vector in Donkey Kong.
6. Identify if structures.
7. Identify else block.
8. Resolve overlapping if structures.
9. Form the if structures.
10. Replace any branch or jump instructions not belonging to a structure into a goto instruction.
